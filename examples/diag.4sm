; to the bottom-right in a loop

#var pos 0x0            ; Labels addr 0x0 with name 'pos'

#label loop
    FLP     pos   pos   ; Flip pixel at (pos/pos)
    INC                 ; Increment accumulator (starts at 0)
    MVM     pos         ; Move accumulator value to pos
    JMP     loop        ; Jump to top of loop again
